# Data Science Pipeline

This was originally completed for Udacity's project 3 on data science pipelines.

## Project Overview: Fashion Forward Forecasting

You've recently joined "StyleSense", a rapidly growing online women's clothing retailer, as a data scientist. StyleSense is known for its trendy and affordable fashion, and its customer base has exploded in recent months. This influx of new customers is fantastic for business, but it has created a challenge: a backlog of product reviews with missing data. Customers are still leaving valuable feedback in the text of their reviews, but they aren't always indicating whether they recommend the product.

Your first task at StyleSense is to leverage the existing data– those reviews with complete information – to build a predictive model.

This model will analyze the text of a review, the customer's age, the product category, and other relevant information to predict whether or not the customer would recommend the product. By automating this process, you'll help StyleSense gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction, identify trending products, and ultimately provide a better shopping experience for their growing customer base.

The future of fashion forecasting is in your hands!
